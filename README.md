## How to use it:

1. Download the code.
2. Go to  [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and check the box for Developer mode in the top right.
3. Click the __Load unpacked extension__ button and select the folder for the extension to install it.
4. Go to the article page (in any journal or website) and click on the extension button (on the top bar)
then you will be redirected directly to the pdf version.

(often the website does not ask for a captcha check  but if it does, you will be redirected to the sci-hub page to pass it)
